# E.D.I.T.H
E.I.D.T.H is an AI which uses computer vision to predict the maximum speed limit dynamically, based on various parameters like number of vehicles &amp; their relative speeds.

The model was trained on an autonomous car's dataset.

# About the model
The model was trained on 6000 samples of 50 sceans with 2 minutes duration each and tested on 1800 samples.

It achived 45% accuracy in predicting the original speed of the vechicle with only 0.9 loss(MSE).
